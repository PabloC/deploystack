                  p Web analytics tools allow to see how users are interacting with your website. Starting from which browser or device is the most popular, what age are your visitors or how did they find your website, up to the heat maps showing what users clicked or how they moved the mouse.<br>
                    | For most cases I would recommend using the #[a(target="_blank", href='https://www.google.com/analytics/') Google Analytics ] - it's free but packed with features. If you are concerned about the privacy, you can use #[a(target="_blank", href='https://piwik.org/') Piwik ] - an open source tool, that you can host yourself. Finally, if you have a marketing team that needs more specific reports, there are many advanced, paid solutions (no recommendation here, as everything depends on your specific use case).

                  h2.category__header Files storage
                  p When you ask about files storage, most people will recommend Amazon S3 and there are many good reasons for that. Not only it's one of the cheapest solutions, but it comes with additional benefits. For example, if you are using other parts of the AWS stack, transferring files between S3 and other services in the same region will usually be free (and fast, as all the traffic happens in the same data center). Also, thanks to it's huge popularity, there are plenty of libraries that will help you integrate S3 with basically any other piece of software. Apart from the standard S3 storage, AWS offers two other storage types, for files that you won't access so frequently: #[a(href="/faq#files-infrequent") Infrequent Access Storage] and #[a(href="/faq#files-glacier") Glacier Storage].

                  h2.category__header SSL certificate
                  p For a long time, the only way to get an SSL (or TLS) certificate was to pay 30$ or more per year. Fortunately, since December 2015, the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG) sponsored by many companies created the #[a(target="_blank", href='https://letsencrypt.org/') Let's Encrypt ] project and now everyone can get SSL certificates for #[strong free]. Go to the #[a(target="_blank", href='https://letsencrypt.org/') Let's Encrypt website ] and check how to install the certificate (they have #[a(target="_blank", href='https://certbot.eff.org/') instructions ] for different operating systems and web servers) or if you are using Ubuntu, check the more detailed, step-by-step tutorials from DigitalOcean (for #[a(target="_blank", href='https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04') Apache ] or #[a(target="_blank", href='https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04') Nginx]).
